## Item I Found

[UNIARTE: Union of Artisans of the Earth.](https://digital-collections.princeton.edu/i/uniarte-uni%C3%B3n-artesanos-tierra/item/228edc47-3afe-4f27-9638-9cb193141e04)

## Finding the Item

Let's start with how I found this thing - I went to [Princeton's Digital Collections Explore Feature](https://digital-collections.princeton.edu/browse) and hit random until something was pretty. I can't read a lot of the items, so I went with something totally visual - maybe I'd learn something new!

## First Impressions

This item's called "UNIARTE: Unión de Artesanos de la Tierra." Going from the metadata it's a flyer from Bolivia, and has something to do with art and labor unions - published by the "Union of Earth Artisans (UNIARTE)" some time between 2015 and 2020. There's a section of similar items, but while they're very pretty art in some cases, they don't have anything to do with UNIARTE or this flyer - that's fine, I'll look at those later maybe, but it doesn't help me with the dive for this item.

I quickly find myself with some questions:

1. What's UNIARTE?
2. Why did they send this flyer?
3. Are these examples of real art I can find elsewhere?

## Research

Okay, let's see what I can find out!

### Translation

In Chrome, I can right click and "Translate" - if I do that, I get this as the title: UNIARTE: Union of Artisans of the Earth.

Okay, so if that's right then this is a flyer advertising UNIARTE, probably - there's nothing special in that title. It's a flyer, though, let's get the second page. This was actually pretty hard to put in the blog - there's no way to just get a link to the full readable image of the back of the image, but it uses [IIIF](https://iiif.io/), I know how IIIF works, and also I helped build this site, so I can reverse engineer a bit. Here's the back:

![An image of page 2 of the flyer, which has a lot of text in Spanish, some images of art on the right, and a title at the top saying UNIARTE](https://iiif-cloud.princeton.edu/iiif/2/4b%2F60%2Fa4%2F4b60a4ba1d3c4d839588d908f70b90c9%2Fintermediate_file/full/,600/0/default.jpg)

They have a Vision and a Mission. I...can't read it, maybe I should learn Spanish. Let's translate again! I can use Google Lens in Chrome to select a portion of that image and ask it to translate - it might be wrong, but maybe it'll give me some neat info.

<details>

<summary>Translation of the back side</summary>

> UNIARTE
>
> The Union of Artisans of the Earth UNIARTE, is an artisan organization with a cultural identity and a vision of social enterprise, founded on November 27, 2004, by a group of young Chiquitanos and Guarayos, which brings together 60 artisans. Legally established with Legal Personality No. 317/05 of September 5, 2005, with headquarters at Calle Charagua No. 37 in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia.
>
> This venture arose from a group of young people with artistic experience, brought together by the desire to improve their economic and social situation through their art, forming their own organization and carrying out their activities in an autonomous and self-managed way. With the purpose of supporting training, income generation through the production and solidarity marketing of artisan products, and the defense and dissemination of our cultural identity.
>
> We are a "Cultural Capital" and we want to share our experience, knowledge, and the roots of our lands, which we contribute to this society with the simplest thing, "the love for the beautiful and the useful", generating self-employment and sustainable socioeconomic self-development, inventing a future for our communities through our art. Encouraging creativity, fostering the abilities and self-esteem of young people in particular who migrate to the cities in search of better opportunities and who soon become alienated, devaluing the most precious thing we have.
>
> It is, without a doubt, our contribution as Chiquitano Monkox and Guarayos peoples of Urubichá, in a space where ancestral wisdom and the need for improvement have achieved their vindication as an option for better days for our society.
>
> Vision:
>
> "To be a model and self-sustaining social enterprise, recognized for its cultural identity and social dynamism."
>
> Mission:
>
> "To defend and disseminate our cultural identity and coexistence with nature, through the production and marketing of handicrafts, contributing to the socioeconomic growth and training of our artisans."

I'm very bad at geography and my education isn't very broad, so I need to figure out some vocabulary. I'll google them.

* Chiquitanos: Indigenous people of Bolivia
* Guarayos: Another group of indigenous people of Bolivia. I feel like I could dig into those two groups for a long time.
* Chiquitano Monkox: Another name for the Chiquitanos people, it looks like.
* Urubichá: A town in Bolivia.

This was really enlightening actually! This was a flyer probably posted in Urubichá to advertise a small group of 60 artists from two indigenous groups who are hoping to come together and make a life from their art. That's actually amazing! I wonder how they're doing.

### Investigating UNIARTE

They have a [website](http://uniarte.org/) on the back side, if I go there what might I get?

It's in English! It seems like they're still going strong. If I check out their [history](https://uniarte.org/about-mission-and-history/) I find that it actually started in the Netherlands. That was unexpected! Let's see, this flyer was distributed between 2015 and 2020, so after they moved from the Netherlands, but before they launched this website.

This is strange actually, their ABOUT US now says "Uniarte is a non-profit organization based in the Dutch Caribbean." I...think this might not be related to this flyer, actually. Now I'm worried about this art collective.

Okay, if I google "Union of Artisans of the Earth" I get this [website](https://uniarte-en.weebly.com/index.html) that seems to be more correct. Their "how to support us" says they have funding goals up until 2015...

If I search the full name in Spanish, I get their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/uniartesantacruz/?hl=en)! Looks like their last post was in 2019. From there I find a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/uniartesantacruz/). A post from 2024! It seems totally possible they're still around, and have just lost their web presence or decided Facebook was good enough. They seem to have an open studio where you can get their work if you're local.

So I guess my theory now is this was a flyer posted in Bolivia to advertise a shop where people could come to support them by buying their work, rather than a flyer advertising for more artists.

Do they have other flyers? If I browse through their [photos](https://www.facebook.com/uniartesantacruz/photos?locale=es_LA) they do! Going back to 2016, but I don't find this one. There are some gorgeous photos of the artists working in there, though - I like this one:

![An image of two men painting on a vibrant canvas](https://scontent.fhio2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/494554448_2615394958652236_7493534871875562374_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=127cfc&_nc_ohc=CU0AKQrk5DkQ7kNvwEdmfA1&_nc_oc=AdnztLnR9lL1j2F67c01FH1yYgXY9RGkERkNqFaI-3QCor_Mn74nzqYY42MTvXUcwO6TZVsuff12SeRpdXEpO5kM&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent.fhio2-2.fna&_nc_gid=xzh5qvcqXhTICG5knDwplA&oh=00_AfdQOkmxakwTDfJCawJxW5CMkVt38CUXEGtmCHufcEvAOA&oe=68E8B7D6)

### Google Image Search

Let's do a quick reverse image search and see if I can find anything else.

Nope. There's a bunch of pictures of birds, some in this same colorful style, but I don't find the group.

## Conclusions

This seems likely to me that this is a flyer that got picked up in Santa Cruz in Bolivia advertising a store run by a collective of indigenous artists. The store still seems to be running, despite many hardships in their area (as reflected on their facebook.) They lost their website at some point, but the art continues to be vibrant and engaging.

I don't know if Princeton has any more information about how they got this item, or if UNIARTE has anything they'd like to say - I guess my next step is messaging them. I'll do that, and update here if I hear anything. Looking at this item I'm not sure who I'd ask at Princeton, but I work there so I have a few ideas.

I learned a few things doing this though:

* Bolivia's in South America (I'm real bad at Geography, okay)
* Chiquitanos and Guarayos Monkox are the names of two Indigenous groups of people in Bolivia
* Urubichá is a town in Bolivia.
* Indigenous Bolivian art is -gorgeous- and I like it a lot.
* Artists are struggling everywhere to express themselves and still be able to live. I knew this one, but I was inspired by this group of people coming together to really try.

## Reflections On Making This Research Easier

The goal of these posts is to see how hard it is to do this kind of casual investigation and reflect on what would make it easier, so here we go!

Wow, language barriers are rough, and I didn't really get the story of the item until I OCR'd and translated the text on the back of the flyer. There's even an OCR download for that page, but it's...not good. [A complete mess](https://figgy.princeton.edu/concern/file_sets/9844749a-8000-4c35-865c-3a421678e7da/text).

Even getting a full size image of the back of that flyer was pretty tough. There's a "View", but it gives me a zoomable link to that image, and for this blog what I really need is a link to the full size image of the back page. There's a "Download" button, but only the full resolution image (which is a giant tiff, not good for this.)

The following are things that would have made this easier, but also a lot of these things are hard and expensive. I tried to sort by how much easier it would make this item to research for a casual person like me.

Things that would make this easier:

1. Some sort of description that just told me what the purpose of this flyer was.
1. A way to download the back page.
1. Translated titles
1. Accurate OCR for the back page, and a translation of that OCR.
1. A way to place where Bolivia is in the world.
